This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where JSON request bodies are not parsed correctly.  The bug occurs when the Content-Type header in the request is missing or is not set to 'application/json'. This leads to req.body being empty, causing unexpected behavior in the application.  The solution involves explicitly setting the Content-Type header in the request or adding middleware to handle cases where the header is missing.
